                <p>Java is a popular programming language, created in 1995. <br><br>

                    It is owned by Oracle, and more than 3 billion devices run Java. <br>

                    It is used for: <br>

                    Mobile applications (specially Android apps) <br>
                    Desktop applications <br>
                    Web applications <br>
                    Web servers and application servers <br>
                    Games <br>

                <h2>Java Quickstart</h2>
                <p>
                    In Java, every application begins with a class name, and that class must match the filename. <br>
                    <br>

                    Let's create our first Java file, called Main.java, which can be done in any text editor (like
                    Notepad). <br>

                    The file should contain a "Hello World" message, which is written with the following code:
                </p>

                <button>submit</button>
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td  align="center">
                <h2> java Syntax</h2>
                <p>Example explained
                    Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class
                    <br>
                    Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter. <br> <br>

                    Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning.</p>

            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td  align="center"> <h2>Main Method</h2>
                <p>The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program: <br>
                    Any code inside the main() method will be executed. Don't worry about the keywords before and after <br><br>
                    main. You will get to know them bit by bit while reading this tutorial. <br> <br>

                    For now, just remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and
                    that every program must contain the main() method.
